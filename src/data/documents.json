This begins with emotional awareness—the ability to notice what you're feeling without being controlled by it.\n\n## Key Practices\n\n1. **Name the emotion** before trying to change it\n2. **Create space** between stimulus and response\n3. **Choose your response** rather than react automatically\n\n> [!tip] Pro Tip\n> Start each morning by asking: \"What am I feeling right now, and why?\"\n\n## Related Ideas\n\nSee also [[On Stillness and Motion]] for the balance between action and reflection.",
